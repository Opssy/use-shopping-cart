title: toCurrency()
---

toCurrency formats the prices of the products. It takes an object shaped like this:

```json5
{
  value: 400,
  currency: 'USD',
  language: 'EN', //optional
}
```

If you don't pass a value to language, it will choose language based on the browsers settings

````jsx
import { toCurrency } from "use-shopping-cart/src/util"

toCurrency({ value, currency })

// returns $4.00

```jsx


````

For displaying what's actually in the cart, refer to the `CartDisplay` component in the example:
