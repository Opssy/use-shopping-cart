title: clearCart()
---

`clearCart()` totally empties out the shopping cart. You might want to run this
on your successUrl page to clear the products out of local storage.

```jsx
import { useShoppingCart } from 'use-shopping-cart'

function Component() {
  const { clearCart } = useShoppingCart()

  return <button onClick={clearCart}></button>
}
```
