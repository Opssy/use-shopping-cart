title: redirectToCheckout()
---

To send the buyer to Stripe's Checkout experience, use `redirectToCheckout`

`redirectToCheckout` is configured for you by the props passed to CartProvider. You can pass it a sessionId
(the preferred way) or refer to products in your Stripe dashboard to fulfill purchases.

With use-shopping-cart's `redirectToCheckout`, you don't need to pass anything more than the sessionId you get
from Stripe because all of the config is handled in the [CartProvider](cartprovider) props.

This is how you'd use `redirectToCheckout()` with a serverless function:

```jsx
import { useShoppingCart } from 'use-shopping-cart';

const { cartDetails, redirectToCheckout } = useShoppingCart();

const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  const response = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/create-session', {
    method: 'post',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(cartDetails),
  })
    .then((res) => {
      return res.json();
    })
    .catch((error) => console.log(error));

  redirectToCheckout({ sessionId: response.sessionId });
};
```
