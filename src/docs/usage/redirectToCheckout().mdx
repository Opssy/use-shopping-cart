To send the buyer to Stripe's Checkout experience, use `redirectToCheckout`

Please refer to [Stripe's official documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/js/checkout/redirect_to_checkout)

Our `redirectToCheckout` is configured for you by the props passed to CartProvider. You can pass it a sessionId
or refer to products in your Stripe dashboard to fulfill purchases.
