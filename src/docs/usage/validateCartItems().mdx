`validateCartItems(inventory, cartItems)`

validateCartItems checks the items in the current cart and compares them with a source of truth to
make sure that the prices and quantities are correct. This is necessary because it's possible that
malicious users could manipulate the values of prices in the DOM before sending to `redirectToCheckout`

inventory: Source of truth. This should be the object of products you sell. It can come from anywhere that
is secure. An API call, or a json file that sits on a server.

cartItems: the cartItems that comes from the `use-shopping-cart`

Take a look at the Netlify example here:
