## `cartDetails`

Cart details is an object with skus of the items in the cart as keys and details of the items as the value, for example:

```json5
{
  sku_GBJ2Ep8246qeeT: {
    name: 'Bananas',
    sku: 'sku_GBJ2Ep8246qeeT',
    price: 400,

    currency: 'USD',
    quantity: 1,
    formattedPrice: '$4.00',

}
```
